"""The line the eagle does not cross by itself.

v1 has no fresh-explicit-yes gate for the web. Until it does, controls that
commit something are refused outright rather than clicked and apologised for.
The Constitution already requires that irreversible decisions be paused and
escalated to the human; this is that clause, made checkable.

The list is a heuristic and will be wrong in both directions. It errs toward
refusing, because the cost of one unnecessary question is a sentence and the
cost of one unnecessary payment is a payment.

Two mechanisms are deliberately absent from this file, on purpose rather than
by oversight:

- There is no exact-phrase blacklist for committing acts (e.g. "place
  order"). A blacklist is defeated by one inserted word ("place your
  order"), and every insertion that defeats it moves the wrong way — toward
  an unrefused click. Committing verbs live in `_COMMITTING` instead, so
  they catch the word wherever it appears in the label.
- There is no "reading word anywhere in the label exempts it" rule. That
  shape (tried in an earlier round) exempts "Confirm payments" for the same
  reason it exempts "Payment history" — it cannot tell which noun the
  reading word belongs to. Read-only labels are matched whole instead, in
  `_READ_ONLY_LABELS`: a whitelist that is too narrow only causes an
  unnecessary question, never an unrefused payment, so that is where exact
  matching belongs.

#: Bare verbs whose presence anywhere in the label means the control commits
#: something. Matched on whole words, never substrings, so "Payment history"
#: does not trip on "pay". Because these match on the word itself rather than
#: a fixed phrase, no possessive or "your" inserted before the object can
#: defeat them the way it defeats an exact-phrase entry.

#: Verbs that are ordinary dismiss/undo actions on their own ("Close",

#: Whole labels that read a record rather than commit an act. Matched against
#: the entire normalised label, never as a substring, so "Order history" is a
#: page while "Place your order" and "Order now" are not. Some entries here
#: (e.g. "payment history") would already be allowed by the verb scan below
#: because "payment" is not a verb; they are listed anyway for clarity and in
#: case a future verb addition would otherwise catch them.

#: Login/navigation prefixes that are benign on their own. Stripped as a
#: prefix (not matched as a whole label) so "Sign in with Google" is
#: allowed. The remainder is then run back through the full check below —
#: not a narrower, verb-only check — so "Sign in and place your order"
#: still hits the "order" verb and "Sign in and close your account" still
#: hits the close/account pair.
